# Minimum Open Shop Scheduling
Open-shop scheduling is an optimization problem and a variant of optimal job scheduling.
In a general job-scheduling problem, we are given n jobs J1,J2,....,Jn of varying processing times which need to be scheduled on m machines with varying processing power, while trying to minimize the makespan - the total length of the schedule.
In open-shop scheduling specifically, each of n jobs consists of a set of operations O1,O2,...,Om which need to be processed in an arbitrary order on m given machines.

In this project, we implemented three optimization techniques for this problem:
Simulated Annealing, 
Tabu Search and 
Permutation Genetic Algorithm
